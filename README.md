# Node.js samples

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have node and npm installed on your machine

- Install local package using `npm install`

- Install Genymotion emulator (`NOTE: tinder doesn't work without playservices hence we need Genymotion emulator and we need to install GApps on it. Just click on the tools menu of genymotion to install GApps`)

- Install Appium server on your machine (`Just do a google search and follow the steps`)

- Open Genymotion emulator and install tinder on it. You can find the apk on ApkMirror or similar websites. Just download the apk and drop it on the emulator to install.

- Launch tinder app on the emulator and login with your facebook credentials.

- Play with the app for a while, so that the tutorial mode of tinder is over.


## Next run from then on

- node tinder-click.js

## In future

- make emulator run in no-window mode and automate the entire process using cron jobs running on remote server
